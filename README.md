"guest" is the username used to authenticate with the AMQP server.
"guest" is also the password associated with the username.
"localhost:5672" refers to the hostname and port of the AMQP server. "localhost" indicates that the server is running on the local machine, and "5672" is the default port number used by AMQP for communication.
